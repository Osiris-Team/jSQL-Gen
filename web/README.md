# web
Generates a jar file that runs as webserver using spring-boot.

THIS FEATURE IS UNFINISHED AND STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!

☢️
It's important to close all ports (except the ones you want to use for your web-server obviously, like 80/443),
since besides this spring-boot webserver Desku has an internal
webserver running on a random port that might be vulnerable to some attacks.
The internal webserver is outdated since there are no other alternatives that also work on the android platform.
